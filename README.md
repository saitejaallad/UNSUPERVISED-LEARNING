🔍 Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using unlabeled data — meaning the model tries to find patterns, structures, or relationships in the input data without any predefined labels or targets.

📌 Key Concepts
No Labels: The dataset contains only input features (X), with no known outputs (y).
Pattern Discovery: The model identifies natural groupings or structure in the data.
Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques can also reduce the number of features while preserving important information.
📂 Common Tasks
Task	Description	Example
Clustering	Group similar data points together	Customer segmentation
Dimensionality Reduction	Reduce feature space	Data visualization, noise removal
Anomaly Detection	Find rare or unusual data points	Fraud detection

🧪 Popular Algorithms
Clustering:
K-Means
DBSCAN
Hierarchical Clustering
Dimensionality Reduction:
PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)

✅ Workflow
1. Load and preprocess data
2. Choose an unsupervised algorithm
3. Train the model on unlabeled data
4. Analyze clusters/patterns or transform data
5. Visualize and interpret results
